[Intro: DG IMMORTALS]
Yeah, yes girl, you are getting very fast (Huh)

[Pre-Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]
The car is racing past 200
The rain is getting very heavy today
Where will you go, girl?
Madam, the car is chasing you

[Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]
You get scandals done, you are a girl from Kalesh
You get scandals done, you are a girl from Kalesh
Why are your breaths getting faster when you see us?

[Verse 1: DG IMMORTALS]
I showed salt to the car, the girl was stunned to see it
The brakes stopped, the whole road got jammed
You are a girl, you are not naughty, you can drink all the liquor
Your mother's cry was heard, you got angry seeing it
I said, will you agree, will you get me killed?
Will you press one or two under the tyre of the car?
Will you get the horse crushed, carrying the goods of death?
Will you make me commit a sin, will you get 302 imposed on me?

[Verse 2: Harjas Harjaayi]
First I will hit a line, then I will hit a line on you
I am a beggar, I will resign every job
Your body is working, I will pour wine on your head
I will write my name in your heart, I will put a signature on your chest
We rap, we don't rape
We can't see you scared like this
We threw our hearts and ran away, it doesn't take breaks
You and my car, both hit at the same time

[Pre-Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]
The car is crossing 200 and racing
The rain is getting very heavy today
Where will you go, child?
Madam, your car is being chased

[Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]
You want to get a scandal done, you are a girl from trouble
You want to get a scandal done, you are a girl from trouble
Why are you breathing fast on seeing us?

[Verse 3: VIRTUALAF]
If you don't make eye contact with me, then crash the car into each other

Your eyes and nose are covered with perfume

You show off your attitude, but don't tell me you're the babysitter

Delhi's parents, take whatever you want from her mother

We'll roam around after drinking liquor, blowing away worries in smoke

We'll beat you up by playing the woofer loudly

We'll take your life, after spending the night laughing

Leave me on the road, after making me swear on your beauty

[Verse 4: Raga]

Boys talk about me, from your city

I was your father before you

I wouldn't have stopped today without stopping you

You also know that I'm the Nawab of your city

You understood me so much, the heat took over my heart

You killed me, I want to break my bed with you

Many of your friends agree with me, I'm a star brother

My every day is on the weekend, Sunday New

[Verse 5: Dark Horse]
I have a score of five, come and sit with me

I will get your toll passed, I am sitting with five near my house

Five plots, five like yours in front, five behind

I will blow money on you, the car will drive five behind

Five in front of it, 05 (five, five, five)

[Bridge: Dark Horse]

Open your bag, clouds will drink and dance

Open your bag, clouds will drink and dance

[?]

The girl is looking crookedly, are you hiding?

[Pre-Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]

The car is crossing 200, the race is going on

It is raining heavily today

Where will you go, girl?

Madam, the car is chasing you

[Chorus: DG IMMORTALS]

You want to do something, you are a troublemaker

You want to do something, you are a troublemaker

Why are you breathing fast on seeing me?"

Mic check, mic check
Yeah, mic alright
Thanks a lot!
Yo, It’s Brodha V
Some of you might heard of me
I talk about money, I talk about rap music
I talk about getting (?)
But now I’ll talk ‘bout god

[Verse 1: Brodha V]

Back in the time when I was lacking a dime
My hopeless youth had me slowly get attracted to crime
Then sat an alliance to talk it out with practical
Minds
Felt a force within me get all my talents combined
Enacted a mime, enlightened I decided to rhyme
Delighted and excited. I'm planning to rap till I'm
Prime
Started spilling ink on the paper and planned to get
Signed
But the world is biased, so wild, they got me slapped
With a fine
I never got a chance, Never let me spit on the mic
Only cuz I come from a land where people ain't white
Day and night I keep flowing, completing all my demo
Tracks
Inspite being denied the right by anti-democrats
Unleash my rage through Music intense
The cultural shock that got my whole community tensed
That's when I, close my eyes and talk to God
Peace in my head, I'm singing this song and it goes
Like

[Hook]

Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana

[Verse 2: Brodha V]

Life is an octopus tryna choke you with tentacles
Survived by only those who prove to be sensible
With only two choices, good and the bad
The hardest part is to be choosing a path, check this
I could've got myself in dealing with drugs
Or maybe pop a weaker person dead while chilling with
Thugs
Maybe, blow up my father's money spending on clothes
Fake an attitude for winning all em feminine votes
One point of time, I got absorbed in foolish lies
Was juvenile, thought it was cool to get into brutal
Fights
I even had the thrilling urge to kill
The next second, the whole feeling reversed to guilt
I was offered a gun, that's when I dropped it for a mic
Took rap as a career and I thought that this was right
I close my eyes and give my thanks to God
Peace in my head , I'm singing this song and it goes
Like

[Hook]

Aathma Raama Aananda Ramana
Achyutha Keshava Hari Narayana

[Verse 3: Brodha V]

I'm being frank and I'm speaking my mind naked
Everyday on my knees, praying to God that I make it
The only hope that keep me going is I know I'm artistic
To levels extreme, my haters agree I'm God-gifted
But that don't mean I lay around like Clinical bait
When its mayhem in my head at such subliminal rate
Cyclic monotony for me is cursed as debt
I'm only halfway through the phase between Birth and
Death
One day, I wish to be like Eminem or 2Pac
And have a million people chanting, Brodha V you rock
And maybe, wish to have a girl like Emma Watson
Or even accept a Grammy on stage while Mama's watching
But till then, I'mma see days when the weather be rough
I better be tough, Brodha V gon' never give up
Now imma, Close my eyes and talk to God
Peace in my head, I'm singing this song and it goes
Like

Måneskin,Beggin',"[Intro]
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Verse 1]
Ridin' high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

[Verse 2]
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

[Verse 3]
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

[Verse 4]
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[Verse 5]
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I wanna paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

[Bridge]
I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

[Outro]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out"

[Intro]
(Rudeboyz)

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Cuando estás bien, te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre 'toy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tiene' ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala (Oh, no)
No me dejes con la' gana'
Se escucha en la calle que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

[Coro: Shakira, Maluma & Ambos]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Verso 2: Maluma & Shakira]
Como tú me tientas cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Shakira & Maluma]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe

Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo, un egoísta

Tommee Profitt/Beacon Light/Sam Tinnesz,Enemy,"[Verse 1: Beacon Light]
I been out here for a minute
Hands clenched as I walk through the fog
Blood in the water
Smoke in the air filling my lungs
You were a friend
Veil torn, now I'm seeing your lies
Full of demise
Blood moon painting red in the sky
Under the surface
Your dark heart leading you to the grave
Beautiful mask
Pure evil behind the charade
I hear the mourning, I hear the cries
Out of darkness into the light
If you want me gone
You pull the trigger yourself
Look me in the eyes

[Refrain: Sam Tinnesz]
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy

[Verse 2: Beacon Light]
You want me dead, you want me gone
Covered in evil you turned on us all
Hungry for power, hungry for pain
You'll kill a man if he gets in your way
I walk through the valley of shadows
I'm not alone, no, I won't fear
The Hangman's at the gallows
I'm not afraid of the death in his stare
I'll never be like you, I'll never be like you
I'm rising up and I'm ready to fight you
Ready to fight you
I'm all in, I've seen you before
You all are the same
You're just another goin' up in the flames
And if I'm gon' die in the fight
It'll be while I am bringing you down to the grave

[Refrain: Sam Tinnesz]
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy (My enemy)
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are (Who you are), you are my enemy (My enemy)
My enemy, you are my enemy

This ends now
Woah (This ends now), woah, woah
This ends now
Woah (This ends now), woah, woah
This ends now
Woah (This ends now), woah, woah

And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)

Benson Boone,Beautiful Things,"[Verse 1]
For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month

And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God

I've got peace and I've got love

You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah-yeah
I know, I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my armor on, show you how strong I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable, I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible, yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful, I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

Imagine Dragons,Thunder,"[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold, have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder

Imagine Dragons,Demons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
Alexander Rybak,Fairytale,"[Verse 1]
Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 2]
Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above (high above)
I don't know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we'll get a brand-new start

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

[Violin Solo]

[Outro]
She's a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

Ravindra Upadhyay/Vishvesh Parmar/Sandeep Patil,Mila Toh Marega,"[Verse 1]
If the head rises, it will be cut off from the body
Where will it hide, where will it survive?
The path, the path is the ghat
The chessboard of death is laid out
If you rise, you will fall, if you fall, you will be torn apart
If you hide, you will find it, if you find it, you will die
Wake up, wake up, run, run
If you can save yourself, save yourself today
It is a storm, it is an earthquake
It is coming with full force
Who has the courage to fight?
Who could stay standing?

Ho, dance, dance on your fingers
Dance, dance all night

Coolio/L.V.,Gangsta's Paradise,"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:

*show ODB with hair*

You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:

""Fantastic Voyage""

Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood

Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside

Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it

A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by

And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned

*video starts*

You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:

""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone

Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke

Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise

You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down

Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street

And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…

So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams

And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success

Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:

They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…

Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose..."
Imagine Dragons/JID/Arcane/League of Legends,Enemy (with JID) - from the series Arcane League of Legends,"I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint"

चटक, मटक, वटक झाली
दुश्मन की देखो जो वाट लावली

बजने दे धड़क-धड़क
ढोल-ताशे धड़क-धड़क
भंडारा छिड़क-छिड़क मल्हारी
कड़क, तड़क, भड़क झाली
चटक, मटक, वटक झाली
दुश्मन की देखो जो वाट लावली

बजने दे धड़क-धड़क
ढोल-ताशे धड़क-धड़क
भंडारा छिड़क-छिड़क मल्हारी
कड़क, तड़क, भड़क झाली
चटक, मटक, वटक झाली
दुश्मन की देखो जो वाट लावली"
Eminem,Sing For The Moment,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

[Outro: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away"

Shankar Mahadevan,Soorma,"Main daalun taal pe bhangra tu bhi gidda paa le chal aisa rang jamaa de hum ke bane sabhi matwaale

I’ll dance Bhangra on the beat, you too dance the vulture dance, come, let’s have such fun here, that everyone goes crazy having fun..

Mann kahe ki main le aaun chaand aur taare saare in haathon par main chaand rakhoon is maang mein bhar doon taare

The heart says I’ll go and get moon and all the stars, I’ll keep moon there in these hands, and fill the stars in your hair parting.

Hello! Hello! Tu floor pe kab hai aayi ye lo, ye lo, baDi solid masti chaayi
Hello! Hello! Too much hai tumne lagaayi ye lo, ye lo, control karo mere bhai

Hello, Hello, when did you come to the floor, take this, take this, what a solid fun is going on here.. hello, hello, you have had (drunk) too much, take this, take this, control my brother..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyaan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyaan

The heart beats, thump-thump, and Amritsar’s bangles jingle, the night is such a fun, some beloved should talk sweetly (to me)..

Chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tere chhanaa chhanaka tere tana dutanaka tera..

Doesn’t have a meaning, it’s more like singing some beats.

Main kabootar faseya ki hor koi fase hi na haay fase hi na

I, a pigeon, am trapped, but no other gets trapped..

Ye baat na maine jaani kyun itni khush hai diwaani tu mujhko aisi kahaani samjha de, samjha de..

I have known this thing why the crazy one is so happy, you tell me such a story, such a story..

Ye baat hai sabne chaahi mile janmon ka humraahi yahaan huaa hai kuch aisa hi samjhe na samjhe na o ho..

Every one has wanted this thing, that we get a partner for all our lives (even if there are more than one lives) here something like that has happened, you have got it, right?

Ab main jaana keh rahi ho kya fasaana ho ho. Pyaar karne se bhi mushqil hai nibhaana ho ho

Now I have understood what story you have been telling, it is tougher to maintain love on than falling in love..

Hello! Hello! Don't mind mera ye kehna ye lo, ye lo, zara mere touch mein rehna

Hello, hello, don’t mind when I say this, take this, take this, be in touch..

Dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhadke ye dil chhan chhan bole amritsari choodiyan raat badi hai mastaani koi dilbar jaani kar le gallan goodiyan raat badi hai mastaanee..

O marjaana oye!

marjaana is a mild abuse in Punjabi, the literal word of the meaning is mortal, liable to death."

[Chorus]
ज़िंदा है तो प्याला पूरा भर ले
कंचा फूटे, चूरा, कांच कर ले

[Verse 1]
ज़िंदगी के यह गदा ले, एक साँस में चढ़ा ले
हिचकियों में क्या है मरना, पूरा मर ले
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला

[Chorus]
ज़िंदा है तो प्याला पूरा भर ले
कंचा फूटे, चूरा, कांच कर ले
कंचा फूटे, चूरा, कांच कर ले

[Verse 2]
उलझे क्यों पैरों में यह ख़्वाब, कदमों से रेशम खींच दे
पीछे कुछ ना आगे का हिसाब, इस पल की क्यारी सींच दे
आग ज़ुबान पे रख दे, फिर चोट के होठ भिगाएंगे
घाव गुनगुनाएंगे, तेरे दर्द गीत बन जाएंगे

[Chorus]
ज़िंदा है तो प्याला पूरा भर ले
कंचा फूटे, चूरा, कांच कर ले

[Outro]
ज़िंदगी के यह गदा ले, एक साँस में चढ़ा ले
हिचकियों में क्या है मरना, पूरा मर ले
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला
कोयला काला है, चट्टानों ने पाला
अंदर काला, बाहर काला पर सच्चा है साला
ज़िंदा"

Bazanji,Fed Up,"[Verse 1]
Too many thoughts on my mind I can't sleep at night, so I just keep writing
I don't need no help I don't need opinions so don't waste my time then
I just been livin online, my city don't show me no love and that's fine
Fuck local radio stations, I got more plays than all of these rappers combined
I'm goin I'm goin again I been goin in
I'm fed up with so many things
I gotta just let it all out
I'm talkin about
The shit they been talkin about
Tellin me I should do this
Tellin me I should do that
Tellin me tellin me things about rap
Talkin the truth and then stabbin my back
They won't knock me off track no no
Too many things have been building, been hard to deal with, I just been drinking
Remember my moves in the past, I'm wondering what was I thinkin
Lately I'm livin in fear
Wondering what if the end is so near
All of the shit goin on
The shootings are strong
One shot to the head and I'm gone
I'm losing control but I can't let it go
Cuz I'm tryna get more and I been in the moment
I been in the zone and I'm moving alone
I don't pick up the phone when my family call
I've been doin it wrong and I don't know what's happenin
Tryna get what I just been imagining
Gettin close and I just been examining
All of the fake shit the game has been packaging

[Chorus]
I been keepin real
I been doin what I feel
I been out here tryna kill
Every beat I know I will
Everything Im working on
Every night another song
They been quiet all along
They gon notice when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I come from a town where most of the people are so closed minded
They goin to school and they workin a job but they don't even like it
I won't be put in a box
Nobody tellin me what I should rock
Nobody tellin what I should drop cuz i do what I want and just know I don't stop
Recordin till 4 in the morning they snoring I'm pouring my soul into every story
I'm writing producin I mix it and master I'm building my craft and I'm not lookin back
I been goin doin things I wanna do when I want to
Everybody wanna get a win but they not due
Everybody wanna copy you but they not you
Everybody wanna be cool but they not new
Woah
Look how I go
Gon be a dentist I still got the flow
Never gon lose cuz I'm still doin both
Never gon lose cuz I been on a roll
Come to ya state and I'm killin the show
Know that I'm young and I still gotta grow
Know that I'm workin the most
No I'm never gon choke and I'm lookin back down on the people below

[Chorus]
I been keepin real
I been doin what I feel
I been out here tryna kill
Every beat I know I will
Everything Im working on
Every night another song
They been quiet all along
They gon notice when I'm gone"

Shakira,Can’t Remember to Forget You,"[Verse 1: Shakira]
And I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
The way you make me feel, yeah, you got a hold on me
I never met someone so different, oh, here we go

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

You see only the good, selective memory

You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)

Denzel Curry,Ultimate,"[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (Ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (Ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (Ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (Uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (Huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (Oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (Damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (Esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (Esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (Uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (Star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (Damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (Flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (Damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate
Bitch, I'm

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)

Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (Damn)
[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, ""Is he fake? Is he real?""
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P.​
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates"
Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"[Verse 1]
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

Ellie Goulding,Love Me Like You Do,"[Produced by Max Martin & Ali Payami]

[Verse 1]
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

[Verse 2]
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

[Chorus]
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinkin' straight
My head's spinnin' around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do

ElyOtto,ElyOtto - SugarCrash!,"[Chorus]
I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fuckin' shit
Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

[Verse]
Victim of the great machine, in love with everything I see
Neon lights surroundin' me, I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong, 'cept for when I hit the bong
Hit the bong, hit the bo—, feel good
Feelin' shitty in my bed, didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears, everything just disappears
Don't wanna be someone else, just don't wanna hate myself
I just don't wanna hate myself, instead I wanna feel good

[Chorus]
I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash
Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fuckin' brain in half
I'm not lonely, just a bit tired of this fuckin' shit
Nothin' that I write can make me feel good

[Bridge]
Where to now?
Got the rest of my life just laid out
Got the rest of my life to fuck around
Got the rest of my life to make sound

[Outro]
Where to now?
Got the rest of my life just laid out
Got the rest of my life to fuck around
Got the rest of my life to make sound

Eminem,Love The Way You Lie,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Banna hai toh baap ban
Chote thora shap ban
Char jan jab karein ge teri burai

O Bhai daye ya baye
Gum kay ko jaaye
Jabb jaana age hai
Toh nazrein karde microfy
Door se bhai han ghoorte jaye Haan door se
Khota ghamand ane mat dena Beta tu bhool se
Upar se hun khatri lekin andar se hum phool the

Bhawishya kya hai mera
Iss baat se anjaan hun
Sath usi ne chora jis ne bola jaan du
Waade na karna ab se Kyun ke bhar raha kaan tu
Mazak ki zindagi hai aao dekho cartoon
Haslon meri halaat pe har ek baat pe
Fir na kahoo ga jis ko aake sath de
Kyun ke jo sath de
Bivi mere sath hai jo 7 sal
Jis ke sath bitaye sath main
Sath main nahi
Yaad main hai vo mere bhi yaad main hai mere
Jis ke sath rishtein mere hone lage gehre
Ek Sath dekhna main charha do do cherhe
Galat hu main nahi samjho ge tum halat meri
Kya karu wohi ho raha hai jo likha hai naseeb main
Galat dikhta hu main is bhari si iss bheed mein
Khota na banna mujhse manzil ke kareeb main
Jo neech hai main un ke liye bohot zyada neech main

Katy Perry,Fireworkr,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
""Boom, boom, boom""
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

I'm fired up and tired of

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud

I was uptight, wanna let loose

Wanna leave my own life behind

In the foyer, take a number

Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

Now I'm smilin' from the stage while

And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond

And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

Artist,BHAGWADHARI,"Shri Ram ji ka parcham lahara ke come hain saffron
Oh, dushman ki lanka laga ke aye hain saffron
Shri Ram ji ka parcham lahara ke come hain saffron
Oh, Ravana ki Lanka jala ke aye hain saffron
These degrees of Trikaldarshi are the degrees of wind speed
Ashta Siddhi Data Ude Prakamya Siddhi Sang
Sara Samudra Ye Longhe, Mahabali Rudra Ansh
Bajrang reached Lanka after killing Simhika
Sita Mata Charankamal, touch this Divine Lalan
Reach out messages, Sri Ram will come, Lakhan Jaldi Hi
Talk, give fruit
Happy Kuldevi, Sita Jagat Jan Dei
Hey, say Bajrang Bali Ki Jai!
Hey, say Bajrang Bali Ki Jai!
Mata Anjani Ke Lal Mahabali Ki Jai!
Hey, say Bajrang Bali Ki Jai!
Shri Ram ji ka parcham lahra ke come hain saffron
Oh, dushman ki lanka laga ke aye hain saffron
Shri Ram ji ka parcham lahara ke come hain saffron
Oh, Ravana ki Lanka jala ke aye hain saffron
Kare Hanu Dwandva, Ashoka Vatika Devastation
Mardan of all demons, Yes, do mere Balwant
Aksha-Kumar ends Mahabali Hanuman
Vanar Veer Gatha Sun Rakshasa Raj Bhayabandh
Aya Meghnad Karne Bajrang Bali Wasit
Let us obey the Brahmastra, five-faced
Respect to Brahma ji, Karehue come astra bandhit
Hanuman present in Ravana's Mahasabha
Wrathful insults, Ravana rituals
Warn Lankesh Ko De Di Shabd Baan Sec
Wicked Mana Nahi Gyan Se, Precious Words Don Se
Laga di, yes, Hanuman K in Agni Poonch
Now let the orgy begin, Ravana's broken heart
Hanuman takes the form of Rudra and becomes a warrior
Lord Agni is also pleased, let Hanuman join us
Jala Di, Yes, Lanka Sari, Sone Ki Chidiya, Guru
Hey, say Bajrang Bali Ki Jai!
Hey, say Bajrang Bali Ki Jai!

Ambabai's Udo ss

This ss blood-soaked lava is heating up
The word of Shivarai is ours
We will soak the fort with the blood of the enemy
We will dance with the flag of saffron
This is the beginning and the end of Shiva
We are the trident of that Bhairava
We will drink the poison of Neelkanth
We will break the enemy's skull by counting
That thirst of Chandi Marathe
That smile of Durga Marathe
Don't go against the lightning
Tearing across the caste Marathe
Blood is the weapon of the thunder whose
Wave wounds money is their
Shivrai's shield is the mine of the mine of the mine
Money is Swarajya, bang, bang
The honor of Shivarai Marathe
The honor of Jijamata Marathe
Breaking the caste enemy all
Saffron is the umbrella of the river Marathe
Come Marathe, come Marathe
Etc There is no end to such Shiva
By counting the head of Modito enemy
The Marathas used to fight for tyranny

Who now incarnates in the form of Kaliyug Shivaraya
It is Krishna

Ajay-Atul/Vishal Dadlani,Brothers Anthem,"Yes, the darkness is scattered in pieces
Shining star which is thirteen
Come on Amber Pay, sign it
Tu ab talaq tha adhura
Hone hi wala hai pura
Pass the limit, you limit
Hai chah to hai rasta, ye jaan le zara
Mumkin nahi hai kya, agar tu thanak le zara
Teri bari hai, what is your waist?
Tere bus mein hain sare masale
Tere tute hue dil ki zaminon pe
Dare to grow
Tere Hatan Mein Karam Hai Tera
Aur Khoon Garam Hai Tera
No arrow missed the mark
Take a step forward
In Khud Mein Tu Waheb Hai, I am ready to fight
Danke ki ek choat ke jaisa har tera var hai
Manzil tuz pe hai fida, tera hafiz hai khuda
Kuch aisa kar ja ke wo bhi tujse puche, ""Bande, batla de teri marzi hai kya?""
Har dar ka hata de kohra
Why do you become a pawn?
Let each target be distinguished
Repeat the story of Arjun
Marham Ho Haram Tera
Aur Zakhm Enam Tera
Bhiga ho jo tere pasine mein
Wahi jeet ka ho face
Mana ab hai farsh par
Tera Hak To Hai Shikhar
Break every bond
Go to your destination
Talk ho is baat ka, duniya ki zuban par
""Upar wale ne banaya hai kya tere dook haat ko talwar kar ghala kar?"""
